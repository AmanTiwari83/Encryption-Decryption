## üß† Important Concepts

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- A **symmetric encryption algorithm** ‚Äî the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.  
- Works on **16-byte (128-bit)** data blocks internally.  
- **AES-256** uses a **32-byte (256-bit)** key, making it extremely strong and secure.  
- Standardized by NIST and widely used in the industry.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- A special *mode of operation* for AES.  
- Combines two functions:
  - **Counter Mode (CTR)** ‚Üí encrypts data efficiently.  
  - **Galois Mode (GMAC)** ‚Üí authenticates data and checks integrity.  
- Detects any modification to the ciphertext.  
- Much safer than older modes like **AES-CBC**, which lacked authentication.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ IV (Initialization Vector)
- A **random, unique** value generated for every encryption.  
- Ensures that encrypting the same plaintext multiple times results in **different ciphertexts**.  
- The IV **does not need to be secret**, but it **must never be reused** with the same key.  
- In AES-GCM, the standard IV size is **12 bytes (96 bits)**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Ciphertext
- The **encrypted** version of your plaintext.  
- Appears as random data ‚Äî completely unreadable without the correct key and IV.  
- If the IV or key changes, decryption will fail or produce garbage output.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication Tag
- Also known as the **Auth Tag** or **GCM Tag**.  
- A 16-byte (128-bit) cryptographic checksum generated during encryption.  
- Ensures that the ciphertext has not been modified or corrupted.  
- During decryption, if the tag does not match, it throws an error:
